# Look and Cook
Look and Cook is a desktop application created using Python that suggests recipes based on the user's input of available ingredients and a desired cooking time. 

The relevant recipes are obtained through a dataset of over 12,000 recipes from online cooking sites. Upon selection of a recipe, users are able to view the dish ingredients, directions, rating, cooking time, as well as recipe reviews. This program applied the PyQt5 library for the user interface, allowing a clean and straight-forward view of this tool.
